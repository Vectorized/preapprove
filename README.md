# PreApprove

On-chain registry for pre-approvals of ERC721 transfers.

THIS CODEBASE IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION. PLEASE DO NOT USE.

TODO:

- ERC721A example with overriden `isApprovedForAll`. Too lazy to make ERC1155 and vanilla ERC721. Please open PR if you want.

- Deploy to mainnet and goerli.

- Write disclaimer.
